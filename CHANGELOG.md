# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Agent personality profiles and appearance context for each selectable agent.
- Dynamic prompt token expansion support for:
  - `[AGENT_NAME]`
  - `[AGENT_PERSONALITY]`
  - `[AGENT_APPEARANCE]`
  - `[LIST OF ANIMATIONS]`
- New chat control button in `Chats` view.

### Changed

- Chat prompt generation now uses the selected agent's personality/appearance and animation keys.
- Animation-key parsing now validates against the selected agent's animation set (instead of legacy static keys).
- Starting a new chat now hard-resets the model session context.
- Selecting a chat now hard-resets the model session first, then restores that chat's saved context.
- `Chats` view action buttons moved below the table.
- Removed the `Back to Chat` button from `Settings`.
- User messages are now right-aligned with the user icon on the right.

- Frame-level sound playback from agent sound packs.
- Added more agents and sounds, with assets sourced from [pi0/clippyjs](https://github.com/pi0/clippyjs).
- New Appearance setting to choose the active agent.
- Dynamic main-window resize based on selected agent frame size.
- `Fork Notice` in `README.md` to clearly credit the original project and creators.
