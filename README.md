# Office Buddies

This project brings classic Office-style assistants into a modern LLM chat app with a 90s desktop vibe.

Clippy is still here (and yes, still iconic), but Office Buddies treats the app as a home for the broader assistant cast too: Bonzi, F1, Genie, Genius, Links, Merlin, Peedy, Rocky, Rover, and others added over time.

Under the hood, it supports local GGUF models and optional remote providers, while keeping the UI intentionally nostalgic.
It is also a tribute to the nostalgic assistants that marked generations.

## What This Fork Is

This repository is a personal fork of [felixrieseberg/clippy](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/clippy), expanded to support multiple assistants, richer animation behavior, and multi-provider AI backends.

This fork is maintained for self-taught and educational purposes, mainly to explore AI capabilities, study implementation patterns, and learn from the open-source community.

It is made with respect for:

- The original Clippy project and its author
- Microsoft and the Office Assistant legacy
- The creators and preservers of these assistant assets

This app is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Microsoft.

## Core Features

- Multiple classic assistants, each with their own animation set and sounds.
- Local-first chat with GGUF models through llama.cpp / `node-llama-cpp`.
- Optional remote providers: OpenAI, Google, and Maritaca.
- Provider-aware model selection from API-backed model lists.
- Configurable prompt and generation parameters.
- Native-feeling context menu for choosing and previewing assistant animations.
- Windows-98-inspired UI and interaction patterns.

## Providers

Configure providers in `Settings > Model`.

- `Local (GGUF)`: runs on your machine via `@electron/llm`.
- `OpenAI`: API key + model selection.
- `Google`: API key + model selection.
- `Maritaca`: API key + model selection.

Remote provider requests are executed in the Electron main process via IPC.

## Downloading Local Models

For local mode, GGUF models are supported. Good sources include quantizations from:

- [Unsloth](https://huggingface.co/unsloth)

## Scope and Intent

This project is not trying to beat every chat client in features.

The goal is simpler: combine capable modern AI with a playful, classic assistant experience that feels personal and a little weird in a good way.
