# Office Buddies

This project brings classic Office-style assistants into a modern LLM chat app with a 90s desktop vibe.

Clippy is still here (and yes, still iconic), but Office Buddies treats the app as a home for the broader assistant cast too: Bonzi, F1, Genie, Genius, Links, Merlin, Peedy, Rocky, Rover, and others added over time.

Under the hood, it supports local GGUF models and optional remote providers, while keeping the UI intentionally nostalgic.
It is also a tribute to the nostalgic assistants that marked generations.

## What This Fork Is

This repository is a personal fork of [felixrieseberg/clippy](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/clippy), expanded to support multiple assistants, richer animation behavior, and multi-provider AI backends.

This fork is maintained for self-taught and educational purposes, mainly to explore AI capabilities, study implementation patterns, and learn from the open-source community.

It is made with respect for:

- The original Clippy project and its author
- Microsoft and the Office Assistant legacy
- The creators and preservers of these assistant assets

This app is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Microsoft.

## Core Features

- Multiple classic assistants, each with their own animation set and sounds.
- Local-first chat with GGUF models through llama.cpp / `node-llama-cpp`.
- Optional remote providers: OpenAI, Google, and Maritaca.
- Provider-aware model selection from API-backed model lists.
- Configurable prompt and generation parameters.
- Native-feeling context menu for choosing and previewing assistant animations.
- Windows-98-inspired UI and interaction patterns.

## Providers

Configure providers in `Settings > Model`.

- `Local (GGUF)`: runs on your machine via `@electron/llm`.
- `OpenAI`: API key + model selection.
- `Google`: API key + model selection.
- `Maritaca`: API key + model selection.

Remote provider requests are executed in the Electron main process via IPC.

## Downloading Local Models

For local mode, GGUF models are supported. Good sources include quantizations from:

- [TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/thebloke)
- [Unsloth](https://huggingface.co/unsloth)

## Editing Agent Animations (Frame Arrays)

Animation files live at `assets/agents/<Agent>/agent.js`.

### Animation Studio (Recommended)

Use the Win98-style Animation Studio to edit animations visually instead of manually editing `agent.js`.

Start it from repo root:

```powershell
node tools/animation-studio/server.js
```

Open:

- `http://127.0.0.1:4177`

Optional custom port:

```powershell
$env:ANIM_STUDIO_PORT=4300
node tools/animation-studio/server.js
```

Workflow:

1. Select an assistant and click `Load`.
2. Pick an animation from the left list.
3. Use `Map Frame Picker` to choose sprite cells from `map.png`.
4. Edit frame properties on the right (`duration`, `sound`, `exitBranch`, `images`).
5. Use frame actions (`Add`, `Duplicate`, `Remove`, `Up/Down`, `Select All`, `Invert Selected`).
6. Use `Apply` (or press `Enter` on `Duration` / `Exit Branch`) to apply current frame edits.
7. Use `Save agent.js` to persist changes to `assets/agents/<Agent>/agent.js`.

Included tooling:

- Live looping animation preview (supports multi-image frames and `exitBranch` flow).
- Preview sound toggle (`Sound: Off/On`) plus frame sound test.
- Assistant-specific `Sound Library` tab with per-sound play buttons and `Use In Frame`.
- Session undo button for recent edits.
- Animation create, rename, and delete actions.

### 1) Understand frame targets

- `frames: [...]` is the animation timeline array.
- `branching.branches[].frameIndex` points to a frame index in that timeline array.
- `exitBranch` is a fallback jump target in the same timeline array.
- `weight` is branch probability percentage (remaining percentage falls back to `exitBranch`, or next frame when no `exitBranch`).

To make timeline editing easier, this fork uses inline frame comments (for example `// #23`) before each frame object.

### 2) Generate sprite-map references

Use the map reference script to generate both coordinate and frame-number overlays:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/generate-map-reference.ps1 -Agent F1
```

Outputs in `assets/agents/F1/`:

- `map-reference-overlay.png` (pixel coordinates)
- `map-reference-frame-overlay.png` (sprite frame numbers)

### 3) Visualize animation flow paths

Use the flow overlay script to inspect reachable paths, branch probabilities, and unused timeline frames:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/generate-animation-flow-overlay.ps1 -Agent F1 -Animation Congratulate
```

Outputs:

- `*-flow-overlay-frame.png` (labels as sprite `#frame`)
- `*-flow-overlay-coordinates.png` (labels as `x,y`)

Optional mode:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/generate-animation-flow-overlay.ps1 -Agent F1 -Animation Congratulate -LabelMode FrameIndex
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/generate-animation-flow-overlay.ps1 -Agent F1 -Animation Congratulate -LabelMode Coordinates
```

### 4) Iterate safely

- Edit `agent.js`
- Regenerate overlays
- Reload app and test
- Verify that intended frames are reachable in flow overlays (and that unexpected frames are not)

## Scope and Intent

This project is not trying to beat every chat client in features.

The goal is simpler: combine capable modern AI with a playful, classic assistant experience that feels personal and a little weird in a good way.
